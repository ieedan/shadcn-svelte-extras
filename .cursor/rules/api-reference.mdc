When generating the API reference for a component only include props on the object of which the default value is different from the value you want to apply. You can use `src/lib/components/docs/api-reference/components/avatar-group-api.ts` as a reference. 

> WARNING: make sure to use the `WithoutHTML` types from the `types.ts` file to ensure only relevant types are documented

Generate the API reference for components in `./src/lib/components/docs/api-reference/components`.

The naming convention for the api reference file is {{component}}-api.ts.

Once you have created the api reference add it to the `index.ts` file in the same directory like so:

```ts
export { components as ButtonReference } from './button-api';
```

Once you have added it to the `index.ts` file import it and use it in the corresponding documentation file for the component located at `./src/routes/components/{{component}}/+page.svelte` like so:

Example:

```svelte
<ApiReference name="Button" components={ButtonReference} />
```
